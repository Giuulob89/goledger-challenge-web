# GoLedger Challenge

In this challenge you will create a web interface to a blockchain application. 
In this application you must implement a marketplace registration interface.

## Requirements

- Your application should be able to add/remove/edit and show all products, categories and sellers.

- Use JavaScript Frameworks for development, such as **Vue** and **React** (all UI libraries are allowed)

## Chose Framework

For this challenge I chose React
I did all the interface in it and tried to integrate to the given api

## Instructions to execute the code

- First, you clone this repository in your machine
- Then, if you have `yarn` installed, you just have to open the project folder (web) in the terminal and execute `yarn start`
- If you don't have `yarn` installed, is important that you install it and then follow the instructions given above
- All the pages are linked. The `register page` is linked in the `login page`, the login page is linked in the `principal page`, the principal page is linked in the `announced-list page` and the annouced-list page is linked in the `register-product page` and in the `edit-product page`

## How the challenge went

I receveid the proposal of this challenge in the middle of a full week
And, because of it, I had just the weekend to do all the job
I spent a day doing a prototipe
Then one more doing the interface in React
And I let to learn how to integrate the api in the last day
Unfortunately I coudn't do it
I had a lot more to do, because of this full week


## Conclusions

Despite everything, I'm proud, because I gave my best and I delivered a beautiful interface with just 2 days to do it
I intend to continue this project, eventhought the deadline has passed
I apreciate the oportunite the company gave to me and I hope that my effort can be considered, cause I'm capable of more
With mentoring and help, I know I can do everything that a comporation needs
And, I know too that if I have had a less full week, that I would deliver the complete project
